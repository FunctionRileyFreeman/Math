    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Dark matter is a mysterious substance that makes up approximately 27% of the universe's mass and energy content. Unlike ordinary matter, it does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible and undetectable by traditional astronomical methods. Yet, its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter and light.</p>
</section>

<section id="evidence">
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>The existence of dark matter is supported by various lines of evidence, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Galactic rotation curves, which show that stars and gas in galaxies rotate at speeds that cannot be explained by visible matter alone.</li>
        <li>Gravitational lensing, where the bending of light by massive objects indicates the presence of unseen mass.</li>
        <li>Large-scale structure formation, where simulations of the universe's evolution match observations only when dark matter is included.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="theories">
    <h2>Theories</h2>
    <p>Scientists have proposed several theories to explain the nature of dark matter, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cold dark matter (CDM), consisting of slow-moving particles such as WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).</li>
        <li>Warm dark matter (WDM), composed of faster-moving particles like sterile neutrinos.</li>
        <li>Modified gravity theories, which seek to modify Einstein's theory of general relativity to account for gravitational effects without invoking dark matter particles.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Dark matter remains one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics. While its existence is well-established, its precise nature continues to elude scientists. Research efforts, including particle physics experiments and astronomical observations, are ongoing in the quest to understand this enigmatic substance and its role in shaping the universe's structure and evolution.</p>
