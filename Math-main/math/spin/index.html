      <h2>What is Spin?</h2>
      <p>Spin is a fundamental property of particles in quantum mechanics. It's not exactly the same as the classical idea of spin (like a spinning top), but rather a quantum mechanical property that describes the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle.</p>

      <h2>Key Points about Spin:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Spin is a quantum mechanical property of particles.</li>
        <li>Particles can have either integer spin (0, 1, 2, ...) or half-integer spin (1/2, 3/2, ...).</li>
        <li>Spin affects how particles interact with each other and with external fields.</li>
        <li>Spin is a form of angular momentum, but it's different from the orbital angular momentum of a particle.</li>
        <li>Spin has observable effects, such as the splitting of spectral lines in atomic spectra.</li>
      </ul>
