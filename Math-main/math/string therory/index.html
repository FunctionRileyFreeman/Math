      <h2>What is String Theory?</h2>
      <p>String theory is a theoretical framework in physics that attempts to explain the fundamental nature of particles and forces by considering them as one-dimensional "strings" rather than point-like particles.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strings:</strong> In string theory, particles are not point-like but instead are described as tiny vibrating strings.</li>
        <li><strong>Extra Dimensions:</strong> String theory proposes the existence of extra spatial dimensions beyond the familiar three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.</li>
        <li><strong>Unified Theory:</strong> String theory aims to provide a unified description of all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantum Gravity:</strong> String theory naturally incorporates the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, potentially resolving the incompatibility between these two theories.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Challenges and Controversies:</h2>
      <p>Despite its promise, string theory faces several challenges and controversies, including the difficulty of experimental verification due to the extremely high energy scales involved and the existence of multiple competing versions of the theory.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Applications and Implications:</h2>
      <p>While string theory has not yet been experimentally confirmed, it has led to significant advances in theoretical physics and mathematics. Its implications extend beyond fundamental physics, influencing areas such as cosmology and mathematics.</p>
