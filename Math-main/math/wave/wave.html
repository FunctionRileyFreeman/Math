        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Probability waves, often referred to in the context of quantum mechanics, are a fundamental concept in understanding the behavior of particles at the microscopic level. In classical physics, objects are described by definite properties such as position and momentum. However, in the quantum realm, particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This duality is described by wave functions, which are mathematical constructs used to represent the probability amplitudes of finding a particle in a particular state.</p>

        <h2>Mathematical Formulation</h2>
        <p>In quantum mechanics, particles are described by wave functions, often denoted by the Greek letter psi (Ψ). These wave functions are complex-valued functions of position and time. The square of the absolute value of the wave function, |Ψ|², gives the probability density of finding a particle in a particular region of space. Mathematically, this is represented by the probability density function:</p>
        <div class="math math-equation">
            |Ψ(x, t)|²
        </div>
        <p>Where Ψ(x, t) is the wave function, and |Ψ(x, t)|² represents the probability density of finding the particle at position x and time t. The probability density function describes the likelihood of finding the particle at different positions at a given time.</p>

    <section id="interpretation">
        <h2>Interpretation</h2>
        <p>The interpretation of probability waves in quantum mechanics is based on the principle of superposition and the collapse of the wave function upon measurement. According to the principle of superposition, a particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, each with a different probability amplitude, until it is observed or measured.</p>
        <p>When a measurement is made, the wave function collapses to a single state corresponding to the observed outcome. This collapse is a probabilistic process, and the probability of the particle collapsing to a particular state is given by the square of the probability amplitude associated with that state.</p>
        <p>It's important to note that probability waves do not represent physical waves in the traditional sense. Instead, they are mathematical constructs used to describe the probabilistic nature of quantum systems. While they may exhibit wave-like behavior, such as interference and diffraction, they ultimately represent the uncertainty inherent in the quantum realm.</p>
