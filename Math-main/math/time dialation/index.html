    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Time dilation is a phenomenon predicted by the theory of relativity, both special and general, where time appears to pass at different rates in different reference frames. It occurs when an observer moves relative to another observer at significant velocities or in regions of strong gravitational fields. Time dilation has profound implications for our understanding of space, time, and the nature of the universe.</p>

<section id="special-relativity">
    <h2>Special Relativity</h2>
    <p>In special relativity, time dilation arises from the principle that the speed of light is constant for all observers. According to Einstein's theory, as an object accelerates and approaches the speed of light, time slows down for that object relative to a stationary observer. This effect becomes more pronounced as the object's velocity approaches the speed of light, leading to time appearing to move slower for the moving object compared to the stationary observer.</p>

<section id="general-relativity">
    <h2>General Relativity</h2>
    <p>In general relativity, time dilation is a consequence of gravitational effects on spacetime. According to Einstein's theory, massive objects such as stars and planets curve the fabric of spacetime around them. As a result, time flows differently at different points in the gravitational field. Clocks closer to a massive object experience time at a slower rate compared to clocks farther away. This effect, known as gravitational time dilation, has been confirmed through numerous experiments and observations.</p>

<section id="experimental-evidence">
    <h2>Experimental Evidence</h2>
    <p>Time dilation has been experimentally verified through various experiments and observations. Some notable examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Hafele-Keating experiment, where atomic clocks flown on airplanes showed different elapsed times compared to clocks on the ground due to their relative motion.</li>
        <li>The Pound-Rebka experiment, which demonstrated gravitational time dilation by measuring the redshift of gamma rays as they traveled up and down a tower in a gravitational field.</li>
        <li>The precise synchronization of atomic clocks on Earth and aboard satellites, necessary for accurate GPS navigation, requires corrections for both special and general relativistic effects.</li>
    </ul>
