        <p>An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. They are composed of three types of smaller particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons reside in the nucleus at the center of the atom, while the electrons orbit around the nucleus in energy levels or shells.</p>
        <p>The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom determines its chemical properties and identity, known as the atomic number. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus is called its atomic mass or atomic weight. Atoms of different elements have different numbers of protons, giving them distinct chemical properties.</p>
        <p>Atoms are electrically neutral overall because they have an equal number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. However, atoms can gain or lose electrons, forming ions with a net positive or negative charge.</p>
        <p>Understanding atoms is fundamental to chemistry and physics, as it provides insights into the properties and behaviors of matter at the most basic level.</p>
