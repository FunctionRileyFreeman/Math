            <h2>Equation</h2>
            <p>Schrödinger's equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It was formulated by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1925.</p>
            <p>The equation is typically written as:</p>
            <p class="math">
                <span class="math-equation">i <span class="math-operator">ħ</span> <span class="math-variable">∂</span>/<span class="math-variable">∂</span>t Ψ(<span class="math-variable">r</span>, t) = <span class="math-operator">Ĥ</span> Ψ(<span class="math-variable">r</span>, t)</span>
            </p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>i:</strong> The imaginary unit.</li>
                <li><strong>ħ (h-bar):</strong> The reduced Planck constant (h/2π).</li>
                <li><strong>Ψ (Psi):</strong> The wave function of the system, describing its quantum state as a function of position (r) and time (t).</li>
                <li><strong>∂/∂t:</strong> The partial derivative with respect to time.</li>
                <li><strong>Ĥ (H-hat):</strong> The Hamiltonian operator, representing the total energy of the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This equation essentially states that the time rate of change of the wave function Ψ is proportional to the energy operator Ĥ acting on Ψ, where the proportionality constant is iħ.</p>
            <p>The wave function Ψ contains all the information about the system, including its position, momentum, and other physical properties. The square of the magnitude of the wave function (|Ψ|^2) gives the probability density of finding a particle described by that wave function at a particular position and time.</p>
            <p>The Schrödinger equation is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and is used to predict the behavior of quantum systems, such as atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles.</p>
