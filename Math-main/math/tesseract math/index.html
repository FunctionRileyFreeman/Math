            <h2>The Tesseract</h2>
            <p>The tesseract, also known as a hypercube, is a four-dimensional geometric object. Just as a cube is a three-dimensional object bounded by six square faces, a tesseract is the 4D analogue of the cube, bounded by eight cubical cells.</p>
            <p class="math">Mathematically, it can be represented as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="math math-equation"><span class="math-variable">V</span> = <span class="math-number">16</span> (Vertices)</li>
                <li class="math math-equation"><span class="math-variable">E</span> = <span class="math-number">32</span> (Edges)</li>
                <li class="math math-equation"><span class="math-variable">F</span> = <span class="math-number">24</span> (Faces)</li>
                <li class="math math-equation">χ = <span class="math-number">2</span> (Euler Characteristic)</li>

            <h2>Properties of a Tesseract</h2>
            <p>The tesseract exhibits several fascinating properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Higher Dimensionality:</strong> Unlike ordinary 3D objects, the tesseract extends into the fourth dimension. Each vertex is connected to four edges, each edge to four faces, and each face to four cells, showcasing its multidimensional nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Polytope:</strong> The tesseract is a regular polytope with Schläfli symbol {4,3,3}, indicating that it is composed of regular cubes meeting at right angles.</li>
                <li><strong>Euler Characteristic:</strong> The Euler characteristic, denoted as χ, is a topological invariant that describes the connectivity of a polyhedron. For a tesseract, χ equals 2, signifying its complex yet coherent structure.</li>
            </ul>
