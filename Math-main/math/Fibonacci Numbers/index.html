            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <!-- Paragraph explaining Fibonacci sequence -->
            <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Mathematically, it is represented by the recurrence relation:</p>
            <div class="math">
                <p class="math-equation">F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub></p>
                <p>with seed values F<sub>0</sub> = 0 and F<sub>1</sub> = 1.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The sequence starts like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so forth. The Fibonacci sequence has a unique property where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, making it deeply connected to various natural phenomena and mathematical concepts.</p>
