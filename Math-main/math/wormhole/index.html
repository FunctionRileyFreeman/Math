    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A wormhole, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, is a hypothetical tunnel-like structure that connects two separate points in spacetime. It is a concept derived from the theory of general relativity proposed by Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen.</p>
</section>

<section id="theory">
    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>According to the theory of general relativity, wormholes can exist as solutions to the Einstein field equations. These equations describe the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.</p>
    <p>Wormholes are often visualized as tunnels with two ends, each connected to a different point in spacetime. To keep the wormhole open and traversable, exotic matter with negative energy density would be required.</p>
</section>

<section id="applications">
    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>While wormholes remain speculative, they have captured the imagination of scientists and science fiction writers alike. Some of the potential applications of wormholes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Time travel</li>
        <li>Interstellar travel</li>
        <li>Creating shortcuts through spacetime</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Although wormholes are fascinating to contemplate, their existence has not been proven, and significant challenges remain in understanding their properties and stability. Research into wormholes continues to be an area of active exploration within theoretical physics.</p>
