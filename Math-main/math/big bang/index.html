    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the observable universe's early development. It proposes that the universe originated from a singularity, an extremely hot and dense state, approximately 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
    <p>The theory suggests that the universe has been expanding and cooling over time, leading to the formation of galaxies, stars, and other celestial structures.</p>

<section id="evidence">
    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>Several lines of evidence support the Big Bang theory:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), discovered in 1965, is considered the strongest evidence for the Big Bang. It is a faint glow of radiation that fills the universe and is believed to be remnants of the hot, dense early universe.</li>
        <li>Observations of the large-scale structure of the universe, including the distribution of galaxies and the cosmic web, are consistent with the predictions of Big Bang cosmology.</li>
        <li>Redshifts of distant galaxies indicate that the universe is expanding, consistent with the idea of an expanding universe proposed by the Big Bang theory.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="implications">
    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <p>The Big Bang theory has several profound implications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It provides a framework for understanding the origin, evolution, and structure of the universe.</li>
        <li>It supports the concept of cosmic inflation, a brief period of extremely rapid expansion that occurred shortly after the Big Bang.</li>
        <li>It explains the abundance of light elements such as hydrogen and helium in the universe, which were formed in the early stages of the Big Bang.</li>
        <li>It has led to advancements in our understanding of fundamental physics, including the study of gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of space and time.</li>
