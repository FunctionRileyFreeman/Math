    <h2>Zeroth Law</h2>
    <p>The Zeroth Law states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. In simpler terms, if two objects are at the same temperature as a third object, they are at the same temperature as each other. This law is fundamental for the concept of temperature measurement and the establishment of a temperature scale.</p>

    <h2>First Law</h2>
    <p>The First Law, also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. It can only change forms. This law essentially asserts that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. It introduces the concept of internal energy, which is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the particles within the system.</p>

<section id="second-law">
    <h2>Second Law</h2>
    <p>The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness within a system. This law implies that natural processes tend to increase the overall entropy of the system, leading to a decrease in the available energy for useful work. It also introduces the concept of irreversibility, meaning that most physical processes are irreversible in the sense that they tend to move towards a state of higher entropy.</p>

<section id="third-law">
    <h2>Third Law</h2>
    <p>The Third Law states that as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero, the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature that a system can reach, where all thermal motion ceases. This law implies that it is impossible to reach absolute zero in a finite number of steps, and it provides insights into the behavior of matter at extremely low temperatures, such as in the study of quantum mechanics and the properties of materials at cryogenic temperatures.</p>
