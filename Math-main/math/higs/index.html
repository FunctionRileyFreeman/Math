    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Higgs boson is a subatomic particle that is a fundamental component of the Standard Model of particle physics. It was first theorized by Peter Higgs and other physicists in 1964 to explain why certain particles have mass while others do not.</p>
    <p>According to the theory, the universe is permeated by an invisible field called the Higgs field. Particles interact with this field and acquire mass as a result. The Higgs boson is the quantum excitation of the Higgs field.</p>
    <p class="math">E = mc<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>This famous equation, proposed by Albert Einstein, highlights the relationship between energy (E), mass (m), and the speed of light (c). It illustrates how mass and energy are interchangeable, and the Higgs mechanism provides insight into how particles acquire mass.</p>

<section id="discovery">
    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p>For decades, scientists sought experimental evidence of the Higgs boson. The search culminated in the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.</p>
    <p>On July 4, 2012, researchers at CERN announced the discovery of a new particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson. This discovery was the result of years of collaborative effort and groundbreaking experiments conducted at the LHC.</p>
    <p class="math">Higgs Boson + Higgs Field = Mass</p>
    <p>This equation summarizes the relationship between the Higgs boson and the Higgs field. It suggests that the interaction between particles and the Higgs field gives rise to the phenomenon of mass.</p>

<section id="importance">
    <h2>Importance</h2>
    <p>The discovery of the Higgs boson has significant implications for our understanding of the universe. It provides a crucial piece of evidence supporting the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the fundamental particles and forces that govern the universe.</p>
    <p>The Higgs mechanism not only explains how particles acquire mass but also sheds light on the fundamental nature of the universe shortly after the Big Bang. It helps scientists understand the processes that shaped the cosmos and led to the formation of galaxies, stars, and ultimately, life as we know it.</p>
    <p class="math">Higgs Mechanism = Fundamental Particles Mass</p>
    <p>This equation emphasizes the central role of the Higgs mechanism in accounting for the mass of fundamental particles. It underscores the profound impact of the Higgs boson discovery on our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</p>
